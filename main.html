	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>

<p>
    First paragraph explaining Time Complexity. Time complexity refers to the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. It measures the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the time it takes to complete. Efficient.

<p>
    Second paragraph explaining Space Complexity. Space Complexity refers to the amount of memory space used by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. Space Complexity is often represented using Big O notation, such as O(n), where 'n' represents the size of the input.
