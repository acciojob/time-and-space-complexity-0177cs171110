	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>

<p>
    Time complexity refers to the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. 
    It measures the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the time it takes to complete.
    <strong>efficient</strong>

<p>
    Space Complexity refers to the amount of memory space used by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. 
    <strong>Space Complexity</strong> is often represented using Big O notation, such as O(n), where 'n' represents the size of the input. 
    It quantifies the amount of memory an algorithm requires to execute.
